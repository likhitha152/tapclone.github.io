    <h1>Gowtham GM</h1>
    <pre>A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.
        I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out
         student. I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the
          month of February. My journey with Tap Academy is
           quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled
            and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and 
            help in learning programming languages from scratch.
        
        I am from the Computer Science branch, but the
         teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a way that
          makes it easy for students from all domains to 
          understand the concepts and technology taught by the
           trainers.
        
        Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature
         with a package of 3.25 LPA. The placement team 
         helped me a lot in securing this job.
        
        Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping 
        me acquire this opportunity.

        <h1>Gagan GR</h1>
        <pre>
            After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my
             programming skills, and my knowledge of core Java
              has also improved. Now, I am learning the Collection
               Framework, MySQL, HTML, and CSS in parallel.

Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem
-solving skills. Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to 
watch all the recorded videos. They also provide 
recorded videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data 
Structures, etc.

I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role 
of Associate Technical Consultant with a package of
 3 LPA.

Thank you TAP ACADEMY for giving me this
 opportunity.

        <h1>Aman Kumar</h1>
        <pre>I got placed in Ribbon communication in CyberSecurity 
            role with 8 LPA package.

            Enrolling at TAP Academy Institute has been one of the 
            best decisions for my educational and professional 
            growth. The institute offers a holistic learning 
            environment that caters to various aspects of my 
            development as a student and aspiring professional.
            
            The teachers at TAP Academy are incredibly 
            knowledgeable and always willing to help. Their 
            dedication to student success is evident in the 
            personalized attention they provide. Whenever I faced 
            challenges, I knew I could rely on my instructors to offer 
            guidance and support, making the learning process 
            smoother and more enjoyable.
            
            One of the standout features of TAP Academy is the
            TAI platform, dedicated to coding practice. This platform 
            has been instrumental in enhancing my programming 
            skills. LMS at TAP Academy is another great asset. It
            centralizes all learning materials, assignments, and
            progress tracking in one place. The dedicated job portal
            connects students with potential employers, offering a 
            direct pathway to internships and job placements.
            Through this portal, I have had the opportunity to apply 
            my skills in a professional setting, which has been
            crucial for my career development.</pre>

        <h1>Varshaa M</h1>
        <pre>I'm a student from the Feb 2 batch, and I'm happy to 
            share my experience with Tap Academy. They visited 
            our college in Tamil Nadu and selected students for 
            their CSR batch, offering a free course that's been 
            incredibly helpful. Compared to other academies, Tap 
            Academy stands out for its excellent trainers, who 
            explain complex concepts in a clear and concise 
            manner, start from scratch, making it easy for beginners 
            to understand, and provide in-depth coverage of 
            programming and OOPS concepts, highly valuable for 
            placement opportunities. I'm grateful to have been 
            selected by Avasoft with the role of Trainee Engineer 
            with a package of 5 LPA through college placement, 
            and I attribute my success to Tap Academy's incredible 
            teaching, as I used the same approach they taught me 
            during them mock interview process. Additionally, Tap 
            Academy offers comprehensive notebooks and study 
            materials, an LMS platform with daily class recordings, 
            a TAl platform for practicing daily programming 
            questions, weekly assessments, and monthly mock 
            assessments and Interviews, boosting placement 
            confidence, as well as soft skill classes focusing on 
            logical thinking.</pre>
